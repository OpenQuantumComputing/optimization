# Openquantumcomputing QAOA
A python library for for quantum optimization using QAOA on quantum computer simulators.

# Installation instructions
The latest version of openquantumcomputing is installed directly from PyPI by the following command: 

'''
pip install openquantumcomputing
'''
...
# Example notebooks
Under the optimization folder a number of examples of use of the library can be found in different notebooks, for different optimization problems. All of the notebooks are roughly structured in the following way:
1. Importing necassary modules
2. Creating problem instance
3. Creating QAOA instance
4. Increasing depth for the QAOA instances
5. Computing and plotting the approximation ratio for the given problem
